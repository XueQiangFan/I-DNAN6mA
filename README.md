Abstract
----
Motivation: The recent discovery of numerous DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) has transformed our perception about the roles of 6mA in living organisms. However, our ability to understand them is hampered by our inability to identify 6mA sites rapidly and cost-efficiently by existing experimental methods. Developing a novel method to fast and accurately identify 6mA sites is critical for speeding up the progress of its function detection and understanding.
Results: We propose a novel computational method, I-DNAN6mA, to identify 6mA sites and well complement experimental methods, by leveraging the base-pairing rules and a well-designed three-stage deep learning model with pairwise inputs. The performance of our proposed method is benchmarked and evaluated on four species, i.e., Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Rice, and Rosaceae. The experimental results demonstrate that the I-DNAN6mA achieves accuracies of 91.5%, 92.7%, 88.2%, and 96.2%, Mathewâ€™s correlation coefficient values of 0.855, 0.831, 0.763, and 0.924, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.967, 0.963, 0.947, and 0.990 on four benchmark datasets, respectively, and outperforms several existing state-of-the-art methods. To our knowledge, I-DNAN6mA is the first approach to identify 6mA sites using a novel image-like representation of DNA sequences and a deep learning model with pairwise inputs. I-DNAN6mA is expected to be useful for locating functional regions of DNA.
